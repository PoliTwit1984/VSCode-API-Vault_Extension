# Visual Studio Code Extension API

## Overview
Visual Studio Code is built with extensibility in mind. The Extension API allows customization and enhancement of almost every part of the VS Code experience, from the UI to the editing capabilities. Many core VS Code features are themselves implemented as extensions using this same API.

## Key Concepts

### 1. Extension Structure
- **package.json**: Contains the extension manifest
  - Defines activation events
  - Specifies contribution points
  - Lists dependencies (including @types/vscode)
- **Extension Entry File**: Uses the `vscode` module
  - Implements the `activate` method
  - Defines extension behavior

### 2. Extension Capabilities

#### UI Customization
- **Theming**: Change VS Code's look with color or file icon themes
- **Workbench Extensions**: Add custom components and views to the UI
- **Webview**: Create custom webpages using HTML/CSS/JS

#### Language Support
- Support new programming languages
- Implement language-specific features
- Add custom debugging capabilities

#### Core Features
- Command palette integration
- Custom explorer views
- Context menu additions
- Status bar items
- Custom keybindings

### 3. API Components

#### Activation Events
- Control when your extension loads
- Types include:
  - Command execution
  - Language selection
  - File opening
  - Workspace contains
  - Custom events

#### Contribution Points
- Define how VS Code calls extension capabilities
- Examples:
  - Commands
  - Menus
  - Keybindings
  - Views
  - Configuration settings
