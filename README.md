## Security

API Vault uses a hybrid approach for maximum security and convenience:

### Key Names (Synced)
- Stored using VS Code's globalState
- Synced across instances via Settings Sync
- No sensitive information included

### Key Values (Secure)
- Stored using VS Code's SecretStorage API:
  - On macOS: System Keychain
  - On Windows: Windows Credential Manager
  - On Linux: System's secret service (libsecret)
- Never synced between instances
- Encrypted at rest
- Only accessible within VS Code
